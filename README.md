This Gamemode is no longer considered the practical standard nor a recommended best practice for use. As a result, we are indirectly moving away from Pawn as a reference and shifting our focus to the development of Gamemodes written in JavaScript and TypeScript, which now become the official standard of AlderGrounds.

AlderGrounds will continue to provide support for Pawn; however, this support will not be equivalent to that offered for Kainure. Our focus will be on modernity and on providing full support for the Kainure framework, designed for developing Gamemodes using JavaScript and TypeScript within a Node.js environment.

For the development of new Gamemodes, please use the base Gamemode available at: https://github.com/aldergrounds/gamemode. It is written in TypeScript and uses the Kainure framework.
